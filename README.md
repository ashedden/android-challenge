//TODO ASAP - I will dedicate an one hour to it in the near future (Thursday?)

Game plan:

    1) Review JSON objects

    2) Set aside an hour to see how far I can code

    3) Code, code, code!

Completed:

    Milestone 1: Retrieve and print out the data received from the url above.

    Milestone 2: Parse the data retrieved from the server into a list of Java objects

    Milestone 3: Display your objects in an organized fashion (ListView, GridView, etc.)

    Milestone 4: In addition the object’s name, have your view display the image located at each object’s icon url.
